## Introduction
This repository contains code for training a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN). SRGAN is a type of GAN designed to enhance the resolution of images, making them sharper and more detailed.

## Features
Training SRGAN from scratch.
Utilizing the MIRFLICKR-25K dataset for training.
Evaluation metrics for super-resolution performance.
Pretrained model for quick inference.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
TensorFlow
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib

## Dataset
The MIRFLICKR-25K dataset is used for training and evaluation. It contains 25,000 images collected from Flickr, which are preprocessed for training the SRGAN.

## Model Architecture
The SRGAN consists of two main components:
#### Generator:
Enhances the resolution of the input images.
#### Discriminator:
Differentiates between real high-resolution images and generated images.
## Training
The training process involves:
1) Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
2) Training the generator and discriminator networks iteratively.
3) Using perceptual loss to ensure high-quality image generation.
## Evaluation
Evaluation metrics include:
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
## Results
Include visual results and comparison metrics demonstrating the performance of your SRGAN model.
